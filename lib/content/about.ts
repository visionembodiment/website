          "Growing up, I always knew there were unhealthy patterns in my family that were passed down. At 15 when my mother went abroad for work, I knew I had to stand on my own two feet and begin my deep dive into psychology and personal development.

This led me to Embody Lab, where I studied under some of the most respected experts in the field of somatics and trauma healing.",
